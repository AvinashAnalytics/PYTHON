# Python for Data Science Certification - Assignments and Case Study

## Overview

This repository contains the assignments and case study related to the "Python for Data Science Certification" course by Intellipaat. The assignments cover various core concepts of Python, including functions, OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), and mathematical operations. The case study focuses on using OOP concepts to create an employee management system and a calculator.

## Module 1: Functions and Loops

### Tasks:
1. **Greatest of three numbers using if-else**:
   - A function to accept three user inputs and return the greatest number.
   
2. **Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop**:
   - Simple loop implementation to print numbers from 1 to 10.

3. **Fetch even numbers using a while loop**:
   - A list containing values, and a `while` loop is used to filter even numbers.

4. **Factorial Function**:
   - A function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.

5. **String checking function**:
   - A function to check whether a string contains the letter 's'.

6. **Palindrome check**:
   - A function to check whether a user-input string is a palindrome.

## Module 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Tasks:
1. **Super Class and Modified Super Class**:
   - A `Super` class with a method that prints a message. A child class `Modified_Super` overrides this method and adds more functionality.

2. **Method Overloading**:
   - Multiple versions of a `Hello` method to demonstrate method overloading in Python.

3. **Encapsulation**:
   - A class with a constructor to initialize values and methods to access or modify the class attributes.

4. **Inheritance Example**:
   - A class `parent_Class` with inheritance in a `child_Class` that demonstrates the use of class inheritance in Python.

5. **Hybrid Inheritance Example**:
   - A multi-level inheritance setup to demonstrate hybrid inheritance.

## Module 2: Import Assignment

### Tasks:
1. **Create a Python module with functions**:
   - A `Module.py` file defining four functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **Import functions from the module**:
   - Importing and calling functions from the `Module.py` file in another Python script.

## Module 2: Inheritance

### Tasks:
1. **Inheritance in Python**:
   - A `parent_Class` with a global variable that is inherited by `child_Class`.
   
2. **Multiple Inheritance**:
   - A class `C` inherits from both classes `A` and `B`, showing how multiple inheritance works in Python.

3. **Super Class with Multiple Methods**:
   - A `Super` class with several child classes that inherit and override methods, and demonstrate how to call methods from multiple classes in Python.

4. **Calling Parent Methods in Child Classes**:
   - Calling methods from parent class using child class objects.

## Module 2: Case Study-1: Employee Management System

### Problem Statement:
**Objective**: Create a software system to manage employee data and perform basic mathematical operations.
  
### Tasks:
1. **Employee Class**:
   - A class `Employee` that accepts `name` and `salary` as arguments and has a `__str__` method to return a string representation of the employee.

2. **Calculator Class**:
   - A class `Calculator` with methods to perform basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). 

3. **Execute Command**:
   - A method `execute_command` inside the `Calculator` class to perform the correct operation based on a command passed (add, sub, mul, div).
