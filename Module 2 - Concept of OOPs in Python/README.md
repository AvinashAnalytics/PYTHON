# Concept of OOPs in Python|| Assignments & Case Study - Completed Work

## Overview

Hi, I am [Your Name], and this repository contains my completed assignments and case study for the **Python for Data Science Certification** course at Intellipaat. In this repo, I have tackled a variety of Python concepts like functions, loops, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), inheritance, and more.

The assignments helped me understand Python's core concepts while the case study allowed me to apply these concepts in real-world scenarios. Here's a detailed breakdown of each task I worked on.

## Module 1: Functions and Loops

### Tasks:
1. **Greatest of Three Numbers using If-Else**:
   - I wrote a function that accepts three numbers and returns the greatest one using `if-else` conditions.
   
2. **Print Numbers from 1 to 10 using a While Loop**:
   - Implemented a `while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.

3. **Fetch Even Numbers using a While Loop**:
   - I created a list with numbers and used a `while` loop to fetch and print even numbers only.

4. **Factorial Function**:
   - I used recursion to calculate the factorial of a number, which I implemented in the `factor` function.

5. **String Checking Function**:
   - Created a function to check if a user-input string contains the letter `'s'`.

6. **Palindrome Check**:
   - I developed a function to check whether the given string is a palindrome or not.

## Module 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Tasks:
1. **Super and Modified Super Class**:
   - I created two classes: `Super` and `Modified_Super`, where `Modified_Super` inherits from `Super`, and I demonstrated method overriding.

2. **Method Overloading Example**:
   - I wrote two `Hello` methods to demonstrate method overloading by passing different numbers of arguments.

3. **Encapsulation**:
   - I created a class with a constructor to initialize a variable and then used methods to get and set the value of that variable.

4. **Inheritance Example**:
   - Created a `parent_Class` with a global variable and showed inheritance by having `child_Class` access this variable.

5. **Hybrid Inheritance**:
   - Implemented a multi-level inheritance structure to demonstrate how classes can inherit from multiple classes in Python.

## Module 2: Import Assignment

### Tasks:
1. **Creating a Python Module with Functions**:
   - I created a `Module.py` file with basic mathematical functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **Importing Functions from the Module**:
   - I demonstrated how to import the functions and use them in another Python script.

## Module 2: Inheritance

### Tasks:
1. **Parent and Child Class Example**:
   - I showed how inheritance works by creating a `parent_Class` with a global variable `num`, which is inherited by the `child_Class`.

2. **Multiple Inheritance**:
   - I created a class `C` that inherited from both `A` and `B` classes and demonstrated how to call methods from both parent classes.

3. **Method Overriding and Calling Parent Methods**:
   - I demonstrated how to override methods in child classes and also how to call parent class methods from child class objects.

## Module 2: Case Study-1: Employee Management System

### Problem Statement:
As part of the case study, I created an **Employee Management System** using OOP concepts. The system includes the following tasks:

1. **Employee Class**:
   - Defined a class `Employee` with attributes like `name` and `salary`. Also, implemented a `__str__` method to display employee information when the object is printed.

2. **Calculator Class**:
   - Created a `Calculator` class with methods for basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and a method `execute_command` that takes in a command (`add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`) to perform the appropriate operation.

## Conclusion

In these assignments and case studies, I worked extensively with Python's built-in functions, control flow (if-else, loops), object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, inheritance, and more. By completing these tasks, I have gained hands-on experience in building modular, reusable, and efficient Python code. These skills are critical for solving real-world problems in Python programming.
